# üß† AI Code Assistant Evaluation: Accelerating Developer Onboarding with GenAI

## üß™ Methodology

To assess how AI coding assistants can streamline onboarding and documentation, we tested several leading tools and models using the real-world [Azure Pet Store](https://azurepetstore.com/) application. The primary goal was to evaluate each solution's ability to understand code and business logic, assist in documentation, and accelerate developer ramp-up time.

### üéØ Project Objectives

- **Primary goal**: Accelerate developer onboarding through AI-assisted documentation
- **Target**: 80% automated documentation/support, 20% manual work acceptable
- **Key deliverables**:
  - Understand code/business logic with minimal existing documentation
  - Fill documentation gaps using available code and partial docs
  - Act as a pair-programming assistant
  - Generate runbooks, architecture notes, and technical documents
  - Reduce onboarding from *weeks* to *hours*

## ü§ñ Model Evaluation

We selected **Claude Sonnet 3.7** as our **benchmark model** due to its exceptional performance in code reasoning and summarization tasks. It served as the reference point against which locally hosted models were compared.

### üîç Model Comparison

| Model               | Context Length | Speed     | Code Exploration Strengths                               | Limitations                                    | Local Hosting |
|---------------------|----------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| **Claude Sonnet 3.7** | 200K tokens     | ‚ö° Fast     | Excellent reasoning, long-context support, deep code comprehension | Cloud-only                                      | ‚ùå             |
| **Claude Sonnet Thinking 3.7** | 200K tokens     | üê¢ Slower   | Strong logical depth, more accurate in complex flows      | Slower, sometimes verbose                      | ‚ùå             |
| **Gemini 1.5 Flash** | 1M tokens       | ‚ö°‚ö° Very fast | Efficient with large contexts, fast recall               | Weaker code understanding depth                | ‚ùå             |
| **GPT-4o**          | 128K tokens     | ‚ö°‚ö° Very fast | Strong NL/code interaction, solid doc generation         | Smaller context, cloud-based                   | ‚ùå             |
| **DeepSeek-R1**     | 128K tokens     | ‚ö° Fast     | Open-source model, excellent local deployment option     | Slightly behind Claude in nuanced reasoning    | ‚úÖ             |
| **O1 (OpenChat)**   | 128K tokens     | ‚ö° Fast     | Lightweight, good for local prototyping                  | Limited high-level understanding               | ‚úÖ             |
| **O3-Mini**         | 128K tokens     | ‚ö° Very fast | Tiny, efficient for simple tasks                         | Not suitable for large codebases               | ‚úÖ             |

## üß∞ IDE Plugin and Tool Evaluation

We focused on tools that could:
- Integrate with **VS Code** (language/framework agnostic)
- Support **local model inference**
- Offer **context-aware** or **RAG-like** capabilities

| Tool              | Local Hosting | RAG/Context Features       | Summary                                                       |
|------------------|---------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **TabbyML**       | ‚úÖ             | üö´ Limited RAG             | Promising open-source project; lacks deep context integration |
| **Aider**         | ‚úÖ             | ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic context features | Good UX, but lacks deeper structural awareness                |
| **JetBrains AI**  | ‚úÖ             | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial support        | Integrates with LLaMA & DeepSeek; promising, but still early  |
| **Cody (Sourcegraph)** | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ Rich context, file-aware | Closest match to Copilot; full-featured Claude integration    |

‚û°Ô∏è **Winner: Cody** ‚Äî paired with DeepSeek or Claude (cloud), it delivered the best mix of performance, privacy, and developer integration.

## üíª Test Codebase: Azure Pet Store

Tasks executed on the [Azure Pet Store](https://azurepetstore.com/) codebase included:

- Generating documentation for pet grooming services
- Architecture and service map extraction
- Runbook synthesis
- Code chunking tests across small/large files
- Cross-file comprehension checks

---

## üîê Data Privacy & Security Considerations

A major driver in selecting tools was **data governance**:

- **Copilot** and most GPT-based tools transmit context/code to cloud servers
- **Cody + DeepSeek** allows local model use, ideal for regulated industries or IP-sensitive projects
- Tools like **JetBrains AI** offer partial local processing but lack full Copilot-like depth

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

As AI development tools mature, teams must weigh performance, context integration, and data privacy. Our benchmark testing confirmed that:

- **Claude Sonnet 3.7** remains the strongest cloud-based model for code reasoning and documentation generation.
- **DeepSeek-R1**, while slightly less sophisticated, proved the **most capable locally hosted model**, enabling high-quality AI coding support without external data transmission.
- **Cody (Sourcegraph)** stood out among IDE assistants, offering near-Copilot functionality, deep context handling, and flexible backend integration (cloud or local).

For enterprises seeking to combine performance with control, **Cody + DeepSeek-R1** presents a production-ready pairing that accelerates onboarding, enhances documentation, and respects codebase privacy‚Äîmarking a major step toward **AI-augmented software development**.

## üìÖ Next Steps

- Finalize DeepSeek-R1 integration in team IDEs
- Test Cody‚Äôs behavior on additional microservices
- Evaluate Swim.ai for legacy/mainframe support
- Continue iteration on file-by-file chunking strategies
- Prepare full runbook generation prompt suite
