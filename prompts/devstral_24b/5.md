# Service Layer Technical Document

## 1. Introduction

### Overview
The service layer serves as the core of our Petstore application's architecture, acting as an intermediary between the presentation layer (UI) and the data access layer (database). It encapsulates business logic, orchestrates workflows, and manages transactions.

### Purpose & Rationale
The primary purpose of the service layer is to:
- **Separate Concerns**: Isolate business logic from UI and database concerns.
- **Maintainability**: Centralize business rules for easier updates and maintenance.
- **Scalability**: Facilitate horizontal scaling by decoupling components.

### Scope
This document covers the design, implementation, and best practices of the service layer. It does not cover details about the presentation or data access layers unless they directly impact the service layer's functionality.

## 2. Architectural Overview

### Service Layer Definition
The service layer is a collection of classes that encapsulate business logic and orchestrate interactions between the UI and database. It sits between the presentation layer (controllers) and the repository/data access layer.

### Key Responsibilities
- **Business Logic Encapsulation**: Centralize and manage all business rules.
- **Orchestration**: Coordinate workflows across multiple services or components.
- **Transaction Management**: Ensure data consistency through proper transaction handling.

### Interaction with Other Layers

```
+-------------------+
| Presentation Layer|
+-------------------+
          |
          v
+-------------------+
| Service Layer     |<-- This document focuses here
+-------------------+
          |
          v
+-------------------+
| Data Access Layer |
+-------------------+
```

- **Presentation Layer**: Receives requests from the UI, delegates to service layer.
- **Data Access Layer**: Executes CRUD operations based on service layer instructions.

## 3. Service Interfaces & API Definitions

### API Overview
The service layer exposes APIs for managing pets, categories, and tags.

#### Method Signatures & Descriptions

**PetService**

```java
public interface PetService {
    Pet createPet(Pet pet);
    Pet getPetById(Long id) throws NotFoundException;
    List<Pet> findPetsByStatus(List<String> status);
    void updatePet(Pet pet) throws NotFoundException;
    void deletePet(Long id) throws NotFoundException;
}
```

- **Input Parameters**: Necessary for identifying or updating specific pets.
- **Return Types & Expected Output**: Return the created/updated pet or a list of pets based on status.
- **Example Usage**:
  ```java
  PetService petService = new PetServiceImpl();
  Pet newPet = petService.createPet(new Pet());
  ```

### Design Decisions
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each service method focuses on a single responsibility.
- **Exception Handling**: Use custom exceptions (e.g., `NotFoundException`) for better error granularity.

## 4. Business Logic & Workflow

### Core Business Processes
- **Pet Management**: CRUD operations for pets, including validation and status management.
- **Category & Tag Management**: Associate categories and tags with pets.

#### Process Diagrams

+-------------------+
| Create Pet        |
+-------------------+
          |
          v
+-------------------+
| Validate Input    |<-- Business Rule: Ensure all required fields are present
+-------------------+
          |
          v
+-------------------+
| Save to Database  |
+-------------------+
```

### Rationale
- **Validation**: Ensures data integrity before persisting.
- **Transaction Management**: Wraps operations in transactions for consistency.

## 5. Data Flow & Integration Points

### Integration Points
- **External Systems**: Integrate with third-party services for additional data (e.g., image storage).
- **Other Application Layers**: Interacts closely with the presentation and data access layers.

## 6. Error Handling & Exception Management

### Error Handling Strategies
- Use custom exceptions (`NotFoundException`, `ApiException`) to handle specific error cases.
- Log errors for monitoring and debugging purposes.

### Error Codes & Messages
- **404 Not Found**: Resource not found (e.g., pet with given ID).
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Unexpected server-side issues.

## 7. Security Considerations

### Security Measures
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Ensure only authorized users can perform certain actions.
- **Input Validation**: Prevent SQL injection and other attacks by validating inputs.

### Implementation Details
- Use Spring Security for authentication/authorization.
- Validate all user inputs before processing.

## 8. Transaction Management

### Transaction Boundaries
- Each service method that modifies data is wrapped in a transaction.

### Commit/Rollback Strategies
- **Commit**: If all operations succeed.
- **Rollback**: If any operation fails, roll back to maintain consistency.

## 9. Testing & Validation

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual methods.
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure services interact correctly with other layers.

### Test Cases & Scenarios
- **Create Pet**: Verify a pet is created and returned correctly.
- **Get Pet by ID**: Check for correct retrieval or `NotFoundException`.

## 10. Configuration & Deployment Guidelines

### Configuration Settings
- Database connection settings.
- Logging configurations.

### Deployment Process
- Build the application using Maven/Gradle.
- Deploy to a server (e.g., Tomcat, Kubernetes).

## 11. Examples & Use Cases

### Real-World Scenarios
- **Pet Creation**: A user creates a new pet through the UI, which is processed by the service layer and stored in the database.

### Code Samples
```java
public class PetServiceImpl implements PetService {
    @Autowired
    private PetRepository petRepository;

    @Override
    public Pet createPet(Pet pet) {
        return petRepository.save(pet);
    }

    // Other methods...
}
```

### Context & Rationale
- **Effective Implementation**: Demonstrates how the service layer handles business logic and interacts with repositories.
- **Business Needs**: Addresses core requirements like data persistence and validation.
