# Petstore API Documentation

## 1. Initial Analysis

### Overall Architecture and Design Patterns
The Petstore API is designed as a RESTful service with endpoints grouped by resource types (e.g., pets). It follows the standard CRUD operations pattern for managing resources.

### API Endpoints and Grouping
Endpoints are organized by resource type, such as:
- `/pet` for pet-related operations

### Authentication Mechanisms
The API currently does not have explicit authentication mechanisms in place based on the provided code snippets. This might be a design decision for simplicity or it could be implemented separately.

### Data Models and Relationships
Key data models include:
- `Pet`: Represents an individual pet with attributes like name, status, etc.
- `Category`, `Tag`: Related to pets but not fully detailed in the provided snippets

### Common Patterns in Request/Response Handling
The API uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) for operations and returns JSON responses.

### Error Handling Strategies
Errors are handled using custom exception classes like `ApiException` and `NotFoundException`.

### Cross-cutting Concerns
Logging, monitoring, and other cross-cutting concerns are not explicitly detailed in the provided snippets but might be implemented elsewhere in the codebase.

## 2. Documentation Sections

### 2.1 Overview
#### Purpose and Core Functionality
The Petstore API provides a simple interface for managing pet information, including retrieving pets by status, adding new pets, etc.

#### Architectural Decisions
- **RESTful Design**: Follows standard REST principles for easy integration.
- **JSON Format**: Uses JSON for request/response payloads due to its widespread use and ease of parsing.

#### Technical Stack
- **Java**: Primary programming language
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building the API

### 2.2 Authentication & Security
The current implementation does not include authentication mechanisms, which might be a design decision for simplicity or it could be implemented separately.

### 2.3 API Endpoints

#### Pet Endpoints
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET    | `/pet/findByStatus` | Retrieve pets by status (e.g., available) |
| POST   | `/pet` | Add a new pet |

##### Request/Response Schemas

**GET /pet/findByStatus**
- **Request**:
  - Query Parameters: `status` (required)
- **Response**:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Dog",
      "status": "available"
    }
  ]
  ```

**POST /pet**
- **Request**:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Cat",
    "status": "available"
  }
  ```
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Cat",
    "status": "available"
  }
  ```

### 2.4 Data Models

#### Pet Model
```java:src/main/java/com/chtrembl/petstore/pet/model/Pet.java
private String name;
private String status;
// Other fields and methods
```

### 2.5 Error Handling
Errors are handled using custom exception classes like `ApiException` and `NotFoundException`.

#### Error Response Format
```json
{
  "code": 404,
  "message": "Pet not found"
}
```

### 2.6 Common Patterns
- **CRUD Operations**: Standard create, read, update, delete operations for managing resources.
- **JSON Responses**: Consistent use of JSON for request/response payloads.

## Verification Steps

1. **Code Analysis**:
   - Verify that the documented behavior matches the code implementation.
   - Check for undocumented features or behaviors.

2. **Schema Validation**:
   - Validate that the documented constraints match the implementation.
   - Confirm that example requests/responses are accurate.

3. **Integration Verification**:
   - Trace the flow through the codebase to verify documented relationships.
   - Validate cross-component behaviors and error propagation.

## Output Format

The documentation should:
- Use clear, professional language
- Include markdown formatting for easy reading
- Provide navigable sections with practical examples
- Explain the rationale behind design decisions
- Link related concepts using consistent terminology
