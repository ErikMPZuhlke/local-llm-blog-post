GitHub Copilot: I'll analyze the codebase and create comprehensive API documentation for the petstore pet service. Let me get started.

# Pet Service API Documentation

## 1. Overview

### Purpose and Core Functionality

The Pet Service API is a microservice component of a larger Pet Store application built on Azure Cloud. It specifically manages pet data, providing endpoints to create, retrieve, update, delete, and search for pets in the pet store inventory.

### Architecture and Design

This service follows a layered architecture pattern:
- **Controller Layer**: Handles HTTP requests and responses
- **Service Layer**: Contains business logic and transaction management
- **Repository Layer**: Manages data persistence
- **Model Layer**: Defines data structures

The API is built using:
- **Spring Boot**: For application framework and dependency injection
- **Spring Data JPA**: For data access and ORM
- **Azure Application Insights**: For monitoring and telemetry
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: For API documentation

### Technical Stack Benefits

- **Spring Boot**: Provides rapid development, auto-configuration, and embedded server capabilities
- **JPA/Hibernate**: Offers ORM capabilities for database operations without writing SQL directly
- **Azure App Insights**: Enables comprehensive monitoring and logging in the Azure ecosystem
- **Docker**: Facilitates containerization for consistent deployment across environments

### Key Design Patterns

- **Microservice Architecture**: The pet service is designed as an independent, loosely coupled service
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts data access operations
- **Dependency Injection**: Components are designed with high cohesion and low coupling
- **DTO Pattern**: Separates API contracts from internal domain models

## 2. Authentication & Security

This service does not implement authentication directly as it appears to be designed to operate within a secure internal network or behind an API gateway that handles authentication. In a production environment, this would be complemented by:

- Authentication through an API gateway or identity provider
- Authorization checks before processing requests
- TLS/SSL for all API traffic

## 3. API Endpoints

### Pet Management Endpoints

  }
]
```

## 4. Data Models

### Pet

The core data model representing a pet in the system.

**Schema:**

| Field | Type | Description | Constraints |
|-------|------|-------------|------------|
| id | Long | Unique identifier | Auto-generated, not null |
| name | String | Pet's name | Not null, max 50 chars |
| category | String | Pet's category/type | Not null, max 50 chars |
| pictureUrl | String | URL to pet's image | Nullable, max 300 chars |
| tags | List<String> | Descriptive tags | Stored as JSON, nullable |

**Example Valid Pet:**
```json
{
  "name": "Rex",
  "category": "Dog",
  "pictureUrl": "https://example.com/rex.jpg",
  "tags": ["large", "guard dog", "trained"]
}
```

**Example Invalid Pet:**
```json
{
  "category": "Dog",
  "pictureUrl": "https://example.com/unknown.jpg"
}
```
*Error: Missing required field 'name'*

**Database Representation:**

The Pet entity is stored in a relational database using JPA annotations. The `tags` field is serialized to JSON for storage in a text column.

## 5. Error Handling

### Error Response Format

All API errors follow a consistent format:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-05-30T14:30:00.000+00:00",
  "status": 404,
  "error": "Not Found",
  "message": "Pet not found with id 999",
  "path": "/petstorepetservice/v1/pets/999"
}
```

### Common Error Codes

| Status Code | Description | Cause |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| 400 | Bad Request | Invalid input, missing required fields |
| 404 | Not Found | Requested resource doesn't exist |
| 500 | Internal Server Error | Unexpected server-side error |

### Error Handling Strategy

The service implements a global exception handler using Spring's `@ControllerAdvice` to:
1. Catch specific exceptions and map them to appropriate HTTP status codes
2. Provide consistent error response formatting
3. Log detailed error information while returning user-friendly messages

## 6. Common Patterns

### Request Validation

Input validation happens at multiple layers:
- **Controller Layer**: Basic request validation
- **Service Layer**: Business rule validation
- **Repository Layer**: Database constraint validation

### Telemetry and Logging

The service uses Azure Application Insights for comprehensive monitoring:
- Request/response timing
- Dependency tracking
- Exception logging
- Custom events

**Example Instrumentation:**

```java
// Track a custom event when a pet is created
telemetryClient.trackEvent("PetCreated", 
    Map.of("category", pet.getCategory(), "name", pet.getName()));
```

### Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)

The service uses the same class for both entity and API contract, which is a simplified approach suitable for this microservice. In more complex scenarios, separate DTO classes would be used to decouple the API contract from the internal data model.

## Integration Points

The Pet Service is designed to interact with:

1. **Frontend Applications**: Web or mobile clients consuming the API directly
2. **Order Service**: May check pet availability when placing orders
3. **Product Catalog Service**: May incorporate pet information in broader product listings

## Technical Considerations

### Pagination

The current implementation does not support pagination for list endpoints, which could become a performance issue as the dataset grows. Future versions should implement:

```
GET /petstorepetservice/v1/pets?page=0&size=20
```

### Caching

Consider implementing response caching for frequently accessed, relatively static data like pet categories to improve performance.

### Schema Evolution

As the service evolves, maintain backward compatibility by:
- Adding optional fields rather than required ones
- Preserving existing field names and types
- Implementing versioned API endpoints for breaking changes
