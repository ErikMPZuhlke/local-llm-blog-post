I understand that you want me to review the codebase and create or update the documentation files while maintaining their existing structure and format. I will focus on ensuring that the documentation is technically accurate, clear, and concise, and that it follows best practices for current documentation standards.

To start, I will review the existing README.md file to ensure that it is up-to-date and includes all necessary information about the project. I will also review the ARCHITECTURE.md file to ensure that it provides a clear and detailed overview of the project's architecture and design.

Next, I will create or update any other documentation files as needed to provide complete and accurate information about the project. This may include creating new Mermaid diagrams if necessary to help illustrate complex technical concepts.

Throughout the process, I will maintain a consistent tone and style with existing content and use proper Markdown formatting to ensure that the documentation is easy to read and understand. Additionally, I will keep in mind the focus areas of technical accuracy, clarity, completeness, consistency, current best practices, and data model documentation.

Finally, I will ensure that all documentation is written in British English and follows proper grammar and spelling conventions.

Please let me know if there are any specific areas or topics you would like me to focus on, or if you have any additional requirements for the documentation update.
