Comprehensive Documentation of Pet Store Application Business Processes
1. Features
The Pet Store application supports the following primary features:

Product Management: Users can browse, search, and view details of available products.
Order Management: Customers can place orders, track their status, and manage order history.
User Management: The system allows user registration, login, and role-based access control.
Shopping Cart: Customers can add items to a shopping cart, review, and checkout.
2. User Roles
Based on the codebase, the following user roles are identified:

Customer:

Can browse products, view product details, add items to the cart, place orders, and track order status.
Permissions: View products, manage cart, place orders, view order history.
Admin:

Has full access to manage users, products, and orders.
Permissions: CRUD operations on users, products, and orders; manage roles and permissions.
3. Key Business Workflows
a. User Registration
Description: New users can create an account in the system.
Steps:
User provides personal details (e.g., name, email, password).
System validates input data and creates a new user record.
Assigns default permissions based on user type (customer or admin).
Data Entities: User (email, password, roles, permissions).
Code References:
API endpoint: /api/users/register
Relevant classes: UserController, UserService.
b. Order Placement
Description: Customers can place orders for products they wish to purchase.
Steps:
Customer adds items to the cart.
Customer reviews the cart and proceeds to checkout.
System validates the order details (e.g., product availability, customer information).
Order is created with a status of "PLACED".
Data Entities: Order (id, email, products, shipDate, status).
Code References:
API endpoint: /api/orders
Relevant classes: OrderController, OrderService.
c. Order Fulfillment
Description: Orders are processed and shipped to customers.
Steps:
Admin reviews the order details.
Admin approves the order, changing its status to "APPROVED".
System schedules a ship date for the order.
Order is marked as "DELIVERED" once shipped.
Data Entities: Order (status, shipDate).
Code References:
API endpoint: /api/orders/{id}/approve, /api/orders/{id}/ship
Relevant classes: OrderController, OrderService.
d. Product Management
Description: Admins can manage product information.
Steps:
Admin adds a new product with details (e.g., name, description, price).
Admin updates or deletes existing products as needed.
Data Entities: Product (id, name, description, price, stock).
Code References:
API endpoints: /api/products, /api/products/{id}
Relevant classes: ProductController, ProductService.
4. Business Rules
Role-Based Access Control:

Only admins can perform CRUD operations on products and users.
Customers are restricted to viewing product details, managing their cart, and placing orders.
Order Status Transition:

Orders must transition from "PLACED" to "APPROVED" before they can be shipped.
Once an order is marked as "DELIVERED", it cannot be modified.
Product Availability:

Products with zero stock are not visible to customers in the product listing.
5. Gaps and Assumptions
Payment Processing:

The codebase does not include payment processing logic, so this is assumed to be handled externally or integrated via a third-party service.
Inventory Management:

While the Product entity includes stock information, there is no explicit inventory management workflow in the provided code snippets.
This documentation provides a high-level overview of the Pet Store application's business processes based on the provided code snippets and inferred functionality.
