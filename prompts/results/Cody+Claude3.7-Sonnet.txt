Pet Store Application Business Processes Documentation
Features
Based on the provided codebase, the Pet Store application appears to support the following main features:

    User Authentication and Session Management
    Pet and Product Browsing
    Shopping Cart Management
    Order Processing
    Audio AI Integration
    Telemetry and Logging

User Roles
From the codebase, I can infer the following user roles:

Guest Users
    Can browse pets and products
    Limited access to features
    Identified by the default name "Guest" in the User model

Authenticated Users
    Can browse pets and products
    Can add items to cart
    Can complete orders
    Have a unique session ID and email

Admin/Special Access Users
    Have access to special features like Audio AI
    Determined by email-based access control lists

Key Business Workflows

1. User Authentication
Description: Users can log in to access personalized features and complete purchases.

Steps:

User accesses the login page
User provides credentials
System validates credentials and creates a session
User receives a session ID, JSESSIONID, and CSRF token for security
Data Entities: User

Code Components:

User.java contains session management properties (sessionId, jSessionId, csrfToken)
Authentication logic appears to be implemented but not fully visible in the provided code snippets
Business Rules:

Users must have a valid session to complete orders (from RestAPIController.java: "Please login to complete your order")
CSRF token validation is enforced for cart completion (from RestAPIController.java)

2. Pet/Product Browsing
Description: Users can browse available pets and products in the store.

Steps:

User accesses the product catalog
System retrieves pet/product data
User views pet/product details
Data Entities: Pet, Product, Category

Code Components:

Pet.java defines the pet model with name and category
User.java contains lists for pets and products
Business Rules:

The system intentionally avoids caching to ensure service calls are made each time (as noted in comments in User.java)

3. Shopping Cart Management
Description: Users can add items to their cart and manage cart contents.

Steps:

User selects items to add to cart
System updates cart count
User can view cart contents
Data Entities: User, Product

Code Components:

User.java contains a cartCount property
Cart management logic is implied but not fully visible in the provided code

4. Order Processing
Description: Users can complete their orders after adding items to cart.

Steps:

User reviews cart contents
User initiates order completion
System validates CSRF token
System processes the order
Cart is emptied
Data Entities: Order, User, Product

Code Components:

RestAPIController.java contains the /api/completecart endpoint
Order.java defines the order model with status, products, and completion state
Business Rules:

Users must be logged in to complete orders
CSRF token validation is required for order completion
Orders have different statuses (PLACED, APPROVED, DELIVERED) as defined in Order.java

5. Audio AI Integration
Description: Special users can access audio AI features for enhanced search capabilities.

Steps:

User attempts to access the audio AI feature
System validates user's email against an access list
If authorized, user can access audio search functionality
Data Entities: User

Code Components:

WebAppController.java contains the /audioAI endpoint
Access control is implemented based on user email
Business Rules:

Access to audio AI features is restricted to users whose emails are in the audioAccessList
Unauthorized users are redirected to the login page
Flow Diagram for Order Completion
User -> Shopping Cart -> Review Cart
Review Cart -> [Authentication Check] -> Not Authenticated -> Login Page
Review Cart -> [Authentication Check] -> Authenticated -> Order Confirmation
Order Confirmation -> [CSRF Validation] -> Invalid -> Error Message
Order Confirmation -> [CSRF Validation] -> Valid -> Order Processing
Order Processing -> Order Complete -> Empty Cart

Core Business Rules
Authentication Requirements

Users must be authenticated to complete orders
Session management includes sessionId, jSessionId, and CSRF tokens
Access Control

Special features like Audio AI are restricted to authorized users based on email
Order Status Management

Orders follow a defined lifecycle (PLACED, APPROVED, DELIVERED)
Security Measures

CSRF token validation for sensitive operations
Session tracking for user identification
Telemetry and Logging

The application tracks user events and logs headers for monitoring purposes
Gaps and Uncertainties
User Registration Process

The code snippets don't clearly show how new users are registered
Payment Processing

No clear indication of payment processing workflows
Inventory Management

While the models for pets and products exist, the inventory management process is not clearly defined
Admin Functionality

Limited visibility into administrative features beyond access control for Audio AI
Return/Refund Processing
